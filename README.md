# Weather API Project

This project is a dynamic Weather Application that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. 
It provides users with weather details such as temperature, sky conditions, wind speed, and pressure for a specified city.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Displays actual and "feels like" temperatures.
- **Interactive User Interface**:
  - Input city name to fetch weather details.
  - Dynamic gradient background changes on user interaction.
- **Wind Direction**: Visual rotation indicating wind direction.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on various devices.
